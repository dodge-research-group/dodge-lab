# Hi, I'm Steve!
But Steve is my [middle name](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62131/18-famous-people-you-might-not-realize-go-their-middle-names), so I use *J. Steven Dodge* to help maintain consistency between the legal me and the informal me. Blame my parents.

I lead an experimental research program on the optical properties of solids at Simon Fraser University. My students and I specialize in using time-resolved optical methods to understand how electrons organize themselves in solids to produce metals, insulators, magnets, and superconductors.
