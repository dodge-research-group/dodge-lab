[Steve](/author/j.-steven-dodge) was invited to present our work on photoexcitations in insulating cuprates at the virtual ALLS Workshop, which brought together researchers from across Canada to share their research with advanced laser techniques. See [Sahota et al.](/publication/sahota-2019/) and [Petersen et al.](/publication/petersen-2017/) for details of the research.
